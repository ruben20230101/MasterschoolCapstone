By building two such heatmaps you can compare the “distribution” for patients that die and didn’t die.\n5. **~~A Top N list of patient IDs~~** based on a chosen metric (creatine levels, sodium levels, etc.) including various Context Filters (age, smoker, etc.). \n6. **~~A Top N list of patient segments~~** by the % of deaths. For example, out of all non-diabetic smokers with high blood pressure, what percentage of patients died? Sort the segments by this percentage descendingly and allow for selecting Top N, if relevant, or keep the full list, if you see fit.\n7. **~~At least 1 parameter~~** that allows dashboard user to interact with the dashboard.\n8. At least **~~1 more visualization of your choice~~** adding value to your analysis.","metadata":{},"id":"076d2b9c-ff0d-4123-b6c5-4cd8dbe9ac96","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# KPI'S\n\n- √ % of people with high blood pressure that died during the follow-up.\n- √ Amount of smokers that died during the follow-up per age group.\n- √ % of diabetic patients that died during the follow-up categorized by gender.","metadata":{},"id":"a7a5e88a-fe42-45d9-a726-bc910bd51595","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"![Masterschool capstone project (heart failure dataset)](Masterschool%20capstone%20project%20(heart%20failure%20dataset).png)\n\n[Masterschool capstone project (heart failure dataset)](https://public.tableau.com/views/Masterschoolcapstone/Capstonedashboard?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)","metadata":{},"id":"511abd31-17a0-4355-b5d2-a8597a861f63","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"_For_ deep dive analysis and EDA follow the guidelines on project [Page](https://cms.master.school/final-project-jan23)","metadata":{},"id":"4da09d52-6cf1-4c09-9717-be28ceafd8ec","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# 1 Setup","metadata":{},"id":"ac33cffa-470d-4ac1-a84f-e8f0f6ce1642","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Libraries required for this notebook to run\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\npd.set_option('display.max_columns', 500)\npd.set_option('max_colwidth', 800)","metadata":{"executionTime":0,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Libraries required for this notebook to run\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\npd.set_option('display.max_columns', 500)\npd.set_option('max_colwidth', 800)"},"id":"b2e001ce-e143-4a9b-9185-1e747164f414","cell_type":"code","execution_count":55,"outputs":[]},{"source":"# Read the data into a pandas dataframe\nbase_metrics_patient_df = pd.read_csv(\"base_metrics_patient.csv\")\nblood_metrics_df = pd.read_csv(\"blood_metrics_df.csv\")\ndemographic_df = pd.read_csv(\"demographic_data_health.csv\")\nfollow_up_df = pd.read_csv(\"follow_up_df.csv\")","metadata":{"executionTime":0,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Read the data into a pandas dataframe\nbase_metrics_patient_df = pd.read_csv(\"base_metrics_patient.csv\")\nblood_metrics_df = pd.read_csv(\"blood_metrics_df.csv\")\ndemographic_df = pd.read_csv(\"demographic_data_health.csv\")\nfollow_up_df = pd.read_csv(\"follow_up_df.csv\")"},"id":"07240fc4-0b8e-4cff-9c4b-6dd2ee9b4941","cell_type":"code","execution_count":56,"outputs":[]},{"source":"# Cleaning operation required to succesfully combine seperate dataframes into a single dataframe\nblood_metrics_df.rename(columns = {'unqiueID':'uniqueID'}, inplace = True)","metadata":{"executionTime":0,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Cleaning operation required to succesfully combine seperate dataframes into a single dataframe\nblood_metrics_df.rename(columns = {'unqiueID':'uniqueID'}, inplace = True)"},"id":"97b52e07-4c51-4049-b618-d6bda1d54963","cell_type":"code","execution_count":57,"outputs":[]},{"source":"# Merge dataframes\nmerged_df = base_metrics_patient_df.merge(blood_metrics_df, on='uniqueID').merge(demographic_df, on='uniqueID').merge(follow_up_df, on='uniqueID')","metadata":{"executionTime":0,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Merge dataframes\nmerged_df = base_metrics_patient_df.merge(blood_metrics_df, on='uniqueID').merge(demographic_df, on='uniqueID').merge(follow_up_df, on='uniqueID')"},"id":"fc44bf47-188f-4143-b679-33d329966040","cell_type":"code","execution_count":58,"outputs":[]},{"source":"# Create a copy of the combined dataframe;

The lowest 7 entries range from 25k to 75k, which is physiologically possible but an indication of a potential medical condition. 5/7 suffer from diabetes, anemia, or both. All patients all 50 or older. Patient #281 is a smoker. The only patient who is not a smoker and does not have diabetes or anemia is patient #230, who passed away during follow up. Regarding the data above the outlier treshold, all values are within a range that is considered  thrombocytosis that does not require medical treatment (<1,500,000) as long as the patient is asymptomatic according to a scientific study published in the Pan African Medical Journal in [2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6607248/)). Every patient in this subset is either a smoker or suffering from diabetes and/or anemia. Outliers are unlikely to be mistakes.\n- **Creatinine_phospokinase**: 29 outliers, all of which are above the outlier threshold. Data makes a relatively big jump between 2794 and 3964 mcg/L, but is otherwise evenly distributed. Gender also equally distributed. Most patients are over 60, but all age groups are represented. Smoking, diabetes, anemia, and high blood pressure are rare. Relatively little deaths. A scientific study published in the Cleveland Clinic of Journal of Medicine in [2016](https://www.ccjm.org/content/83/1/37) elucidated this seemingly odd phenomenon: misdiagnosis is common and the status quo is being tested. Even though this paper uses UI (International Unit), which cannot be directly translated to mcg/L, because it measures potency rather than blood levels, it does state that, on average, the upper limit should be twice as high. Additionally, it also states that CPK levels are highly dependent on race and gender. Exercise can temporarily increase CPK levels 30-fold, which can take up to a week to fully subside. Finally, the distribution of data collected on the blood levels of this enzyme tends to be non-Gaussian and negatively skewed. In conclusion, it is possible that this data is either an indication of a confounding factor (e.g., muscular dystrophy), that the patient recently did an intense workout, or that it is actually within a healthy range.\n- **Serum_creatinine**: For the analaysis of this variable I opt a less research-oriented and a more analyist-approach. For this variable, 29 observations fall outside the maximum boxplot whisker-length 1.5 x IQR. As can be observed from the boxplot and the data generated by the outlier-script, IQR stretches between 1.0 and 1.5, whereas whisker length (1.5 x IQR both ways) is about 0.5 to 2.0. Everything from 2.2 and up is, mathemically speaking, an outlier. Based on the distribution I would suggest considering the number of data points to further research the values between 2.2 and 3.3 and remove everything from 3.4 (patient #129) and up.","metadata":{},"id":"b8f278b8-6f49-4d5b-9255-be34f362fe71","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"## Cleaning part 2: removal of columns based on distribution analysis","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"170e97e6-4dc7-404d-8639-84aae986d2fb"},{"source":"# This code creates a new dataframe df_clean that includes only the observations that are within 1.5 x IQR for the 3 variables analyzed (228 rows, 71 observations removed)\n\ndf_clean = df[(df['platelets'] >= p_outlier_threshold[0]) &\n              (df['platelets'] <= p_outlier_threshold[1]) &\n              (df['creatinine_phosphokinase'] >= c_outlier_threshold[0]) &\n              (df['creatinine_phosphokinase'] <= c_outlier_threshold[1]) &\n              (df['serum_creatinine'] >= s_outlier_threshold[0]) &\n              (df['serum_creatinine'] <= s_outlier_threshold[1])]","metadata":{"executionTime":0,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# This code creates a new dataframe df_clean that includes only the observations that are within 1.5 x IQR for the 3 variables analyzed (228 rows, 71 observations removed)\n\ndf_clean = df[(df['platelets'] >= p_outlier_threshold[0]) &\n              (df['platelets'] <= p_outlier_threshold[1]) &\n              (df['creatinine_phosphokinase'] >= c_outlier_threshold[0]) &\n              (df['creatinine_phosphokinase'] <= c_outlier_threshold[1]) &\n              (df['serum_creatinine'] >= s_outlier_threshold[0]) &\n              (df['serum_creatinine'] <= s_outlier_threshold[1])]"},"cell_type":"code","id":"3ebc86a5-c25a-47fb-9624-2b769dcd8af2","execution_count":80,"outputs":[]},{"source":"df_clean.shape","metadata":{"executionTime":0,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"df_clean.shape"},"cell_type":"code","id":"3da51f2a-acdb-465f-8935-5e84ec48cb05","execution_count":81,"outputs":[]},{"source":"## Notes on preceding cleaning operations\n- All original **.csv** files can be generated at the beginning of this script.\n- **df_merged** contains all columns from all datasets, merged on uniqueid, no further modifications made.\n- **df** contains modified column names, datatypes, data, and reorganization, but still contains all observations.\n- **df_clean** is **df** with all observations that fell outside the 1.5 x IQR range for the three variables analyzed removed.","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"3d3c0da1-1d9a-47ae-94c2-71f7cb5b3db1"},{"source":"# 5 Cross-Correlation Analysis","metadata":{},"id":"71b76cff-2a19-4dfa-9c65-d01f9eb90f78","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"plt.subplots(figsize=(12, 10))\nsns.heatmap(df_clean.corr(), cmap='Accent', annot=True)\nplt.show()","metadata":{"executionTime":605,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"plt.subplots(figsize=(12, 10))\nsns.heatmap(df_clean.corr(), cmap='Accent', annot=True)\nplt.show()"},"cell_type":"code","id":"f75563e7-c5a6-42b3-9540-d0fe3db507f7","execution_count":82,"outputs":[]},{"source":"# Cross-Correlation Analysis summary\n\n## The classification according to Pearson's correlation coefficient (the CC used in the generation of this heatmap) is:\n- 0.7 to 1.0: strong positive correlation\n- 0.5 to 0.7: moderate positive correlation\n- 0.3 to 0.5: weak positive correlation\n- -0.7 to -0.5: moderate negative correlation\n- -1.0 to -0.7: strong negative correlation\n\n## Summary\n- I will not discuss the correlations between _uniqueid_/_time_/_death_event_/itself for obvious reasons.\n- The only category in this heatmap that is worth discussing is the indicated by dark blue: approximately between 0.2 and 4, although even the strongest correlations in this dataset is still only weak positive at best.\n- The fact that there is a weak positive relationship between _serum_creatinine_, _age_ and _death_event_ is interesting although predictable: the probability of dying due to age is very weak, meaning that the probability of dying is determined by a complex interaction between multiple variables.\n- The most interesting relationship in this dataset is the relational triangle between _age_, _serum_creatinine_, and _death_event_. _Serum_creatinine_ and age have the 3rd-strongest correlation (which is still considered \"_no relationship_\") in this dataset; apparently _serum_creatinine_ naturally goes up with age.
