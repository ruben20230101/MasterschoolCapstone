# Masterschool final project

Capstone project on heart failure as a part of the Masterschool Data Analytics program.

## The story behind The Data

Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the number 1 cause of death all over the world, taking an estimated **17.9** million lives each year, which accounts for 31% of all deaths worldwide.
Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs and this dataset contains 12 features that can be used to predict mortality by heart failure, as well as analyze and understand the main factor for these diseases.

Most cardiovascular diseases can be prevented by addressing behavioural risk factors such as tobacco use, unhealthy diet and obesity, physical inactivity and harmful use of alcohol using population-wide strategies.

People with CV disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia or already established disease) need early detection and management wherein a great analysis of it can be of great help.
